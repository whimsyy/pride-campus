# pride-campus 🏳️‍🌈

## The problem Pride 🏳️‍🌈 Campus solves 💡

We often wanted to explore Discord APIs as well since me and my teammates use Discord daily and being active in several communities has made us realize how important it is to tell new members how a community is built upon inclusive and diverse nature and that we should respect one's space around us whether we are in online or in offline mode. We ourselves took a long time to understand hence decided to make a bot aware people about the same.

## What it does do? ❓❓

It responds to slash commands which are in the Features section. 😮

## How do we build it? 💻💻

- UI/UX part along with functionalities using Discord.js and Postman Mock API. 🤞🏻
- NLP part powered by Co:here AI with which the bot is gonna interact. 🤯
- We have used google cloud APIs for language translation purposes so everyone from different regions can use our app without facing any problems.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 🎖️🎖️🎖️

- We are now debugging gangsta.
- Being able to get communicate using the Blockchain. Working together as a small group.

## What did we learn?
- Learned a new stack and adapted it fully and quickly.
- How to work on a team of half UX/UI designers and researchers and half developers. 💻
- We also learned how to work remotely. We learned how to use new tools for remote work, like VS Code's Live Share features, ngrok for localhost port forwarding, GitHub for collaboration, and how to integrate APIs with the software.

## What's next for Pride Campus? 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈

- As there was no API related to STEM opportunities specific to the LGBTQ+ community, we used Postman Mock API for the same and if we can then we are planning to maintain a database for real job opportunities for the LGBTQ+ community and update it from time to time.
- For the UI part. In the future, if one Trust needs something to donate but lacks things then another Trust can hand over things to that trust which they required.

## Challenges we ran into

From 'Application not responding to Deployment', we have understood how important every single line of code is.
